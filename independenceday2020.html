           <h2><b><strong>History:</strong></b> </h4>
           <p>India was ruled by the Britishers for many years. The East India Company ruled India for about 100 years.<br> It was in 1757 when the East India Company won the battle of Plassey. It was after the win went the Company started exerting<br> power over India. Our nation had its rebellion against the foreign rule for the first time in 1957. The entire country united against British power. It was an unfortunate event as India <br>was defeated back then but after that time. Indian rule was then passed to the British who ruled our country till India got its independence.<br> Our nation faced a long campaign to gain independence. Britain then began to weaken after two world wars and India was finally free.<br> India's freedom struggle has always been an inspiration to the work as it was the most non-violent campaign in the world.</p>
